WiFileShare is a user-friendly file sharing application designed to facilitate seamless collaboration within your local WiFi network. This software provides a quick and efficient means of transferring files between connected devices, eliminating the reliance on external internet connections. Whether you're collaborating on a project or simply sharing media files with friends, WiFileShare ensures a hassle-free experience.

## Key Features

- **Localized File Transfer:** WiFileShare enables users to send and receive files instantly within the confines of their WiFi network. This ensures a secure and efficient transfer process, making it ideal for various scenarios such as team collaboration, home networks, or educational settings.
- **Mobile Hotspot Compatibility:** In addition to local WiFi networks, WiFileShare is compatible with mobile hotspots. This feature allows users to share files even in situations where traditional WiFi may not be available, as long as both devices are connected to the same network.
- **Cross-Windows Compatibility:** WiFileShare is designed to work seamlessly across different Windows operating systems, including Windows 10 and Windows 11. This cross-Windows compatibility ensures that users can enjoy the benefits of WiFileShare regardless of their preferred Windows version.
